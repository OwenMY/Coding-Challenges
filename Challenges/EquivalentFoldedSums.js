/*
You are given a list of integers nums of even length. Consider an operation where you pick any number in nums and update it with a value between [1, max(nums)].

Return the minimum number of operations required such that for every i, nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] equals to the same number.

Constraints
n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10,000

Input
nums = [1, 4, 3, 5]

Output
1
